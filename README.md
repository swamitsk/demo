# A Sample Crud app for bank cards

1. Used Rest Assured for testing
2. The UI is quite simple, developed with Angular JS( does not take in nick name)
3. The same can however be passed from API testing tool like postman
4. Am not using Services / DTO to make it simple
5. Added the Card Determining procedure into the controller for simplicity again.
6. Use the in memory database
